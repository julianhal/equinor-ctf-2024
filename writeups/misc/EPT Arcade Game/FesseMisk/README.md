## Solution

The game is a simple game that one can play. Looking at the index we can see a interesting url: `https://a8261cebfbaccblob.blob.core.windows.net/private/ept.svg`. 

From this we can see that the game is hosted on Azure Blob Storage. We can use the Azure CLI to list the blobs in the container.
```bash
‚ùØ  az storage blob list --account-name a8261cebfbaccblob --container-name private --output table

There are no credentials provided in your command and environment, we will query for account key for your storage account.
It is recommended to provide --connection-string, --account-key or --sas-token in your command as credentials.

You also can add `--auth-mode login` in your command to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authorization if your login account is assigned required RBAC roles.
For more information about RBAC roles in storage, visit https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-cli.

In addition, setting the corresponding environment variables can avoid inputting credentials in your command. Please use --help to get more information about environment variable usage.

Skip querying account key due to failure: Please run 'az login' to setup account.

```

Here we can see that there is a flag in the container. We can download it using the Azure CLI again.
```bash
az storage blob download --account-name a8261cebfbaccblob --container-name private --name flag-1s-h3r3.txt --file ./flag-1s-h3r3.txt
```
